# Instagramation

Instagramation is unfollow-automation script that unfollows users which don't follow back. It runs in Chrome's Dev-Tools. You just need to provide cookie token taken from your session.
## Setting up

By pressing **CTRL-SHIFT-I** while you are logged in you can find your **ds_user_id** and **csrftoken** under the value column.


Next step is to copy the script into Dev-Tools which open while pressing F12 while you are on your Instagram's homepage.

And the final step is to fill the script with desired parameteres and you are ready to go.

## Limits
Your instagram actions are limited.

They limit the actions you do because otherwise it seems spammy.
My advice - Do not go above **200 unfollows per day**. The higher delay between the requests is the safer it is.
